Fright b-0.1.0

Thanks for attempting to try out the Fright Public Beta. As you can tell from the look and feel, the game is far from finished. This version is mainly an assimilation of several different proofs-of-concepts. Despite that, this beta does give you a general idea of the intended gameplay experience.

An aspect ratio of 16:9 is highly recommended.

--------------------------------------

STRATEGY

Ideally, the player would try to get through the entire night succesfully (meaning the clock hand would go from 12 to 3). To do this, the player should keep tabs on what enemies are in the house that night, where they are, and what damage they can do. Not all enemies are capable of killing the player, although they can surely assist in the player's death. To understand how to deal with each enemy, the Journal in this version has been overwritten with information about each enemy.

-----------------------------------

PROGRESSION

As of now, the game does not unlock new nights or upgrades for each night beaten. What can be seen in each progressive night is the enemy agression (lightning bolt), the amount of enemies that night (eye), and the time in minutes (clock).

STORY (as of now, might be subject to change)

14-year old Morton Moore winds up being the voluntary house-sitter while his parents go on a romantic getaway, while the rest of his family goes on vacation. Obsessed with getting to the bottom of the mysteries within the family manor, Morton depicts his suspicions and discoveries within his journal. Coincidentally, some supernatural breakdowns in cooperation lead to Morton's potential demise, as he is met with forces beyond his comprehension. As the quality of his sleep and mental health dwindle, Morton falls on the brink of insanity. Can he keep whatever is out there away long enough for help to arrive?
